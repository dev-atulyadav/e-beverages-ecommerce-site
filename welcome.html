                    <p>Masala chai is the most popular tea that holds a very special place in the heart of every Indian.
                        The
                        aromatic flavour of the tea is enhanced with the punchy essence of numerous desi spices like
                        ginger,
                        cardamom, and cinnamon among others. Cold winter mornings or monsoon evenings, a cup of this
                        chai is
                        unbeatable at all times.</p>

                        sans spices and milk and is the simplest one to make. You just need the right tea leaves for it

                        love to
                        sip on, almost throughout the year, but more during the super chilly winter months. The

                        prepare it is in a special brass kettle known as samovar with the special Kashmiri green tea

                    <p>There is a very interesting story behind the famed Irani Chai. It is said that the Persians came
                        to Mumbai
                        in search of a better life, then migrated to Pune and landed in Hyderabad bringing the delish
                        Irani chai
                        with them. Unlike the traditional way of preparing tea, you have to boil the tea leaves and the
                        milk in
                        separate containers. to make this one.</p>

                        gur chai
                        in Ladakh. This tea is prepared with black tea leaves as the base and the addition of yak
                        butter, salt, some
                        milk, and water. Making it is a little complex, but the flavour is very special too. It acts as

                        water, which
                        releases their flavor, color, caffeine content, and nutrients. Although coffee is often served
                        hot, it can
                        also be served iced.In many countries, including the United States, coffee is typically enjoyed
                        with
                        breakfast. It’s favored in the mornings.</p>

                        the

                        frothed milk on top. These elements combined result in a balanced milky coffee that possesses an

                    <p>A cappuccino is the perfect balance of espresso, steamed milk and foam. This coffee is all about

                        rich, but not acidic and have a mildly sweet flavouring from the milk. And, because the milk is
                        not actually
                        mixed in it gives the espresso a stronger flavour.</p>

                    <p>espresso, (Italian: “fast, express”) a strong brew of coffee produced by forcing boiled water
                        under
                        pressure through finely ground coffee. The finely ground coffee beans means an increased amount
                        of surface
                        contact with the water, resulting in a highly flavoured and aromatic brew. The nuances of
                        brewing and
                        enjoying the drink have spurred.</p>

                    <p>The galao comes from Portugal, where it’s a popular cafe drink served at breakfast time. A galao
                        comprises
                        one part espresso and three parts frothed milk, making it very similar to a latte.
                        You’ll find that Portuguese people often serve coffee with plenty of sugar or milk. This is due
                        to the
                        tradition of using a blend with a high proportion of Robusta beans.</p>
